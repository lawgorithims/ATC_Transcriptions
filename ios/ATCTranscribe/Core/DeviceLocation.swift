/// Continuous device-GPS ownship — for the cockpit iPad/iPhone with NO Stratux. A plain (non-@MainActor)
/// object like `OneShotLocation`: `CLLocationManager` is created on the main thread and delivers its
/// callbacks there, and the project's Swift 5 mode doesn't enforce actor isolation on the delegate.
///
/// Observed DIRECTLY by the views that plot ownship (map + plate viewer) — a nested ObservableObject on
/// AppModel doesn't republish its parent (see the Flight Bag C2 fix). GPS lifecycle is owned by the
/// always-mounted home map (MapHostView starts it once) and paused/resumed by scene phase, so it's a
/// single session that the other tabs only READ (they no longer start/stop it, which used to leave the
/// map's ownship marker frozen). The map draws its own ownship symbol from this feed — MKMapView's
/// built-in `showsUserLocation` (a redundant second GPS session) is off.
